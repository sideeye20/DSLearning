# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction

Welcome to my first machine learning project! This notebook explores the classic Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival using a neural network built with TensorFlow and Keras.

As a Computer Science student specializing in Data Science, I created this project to deepen my understanding of feature engineering, model building, and data preprocessing. It’s one of the first models I ever built—so while it’s not perfect, it reflects how far I’ve come and how much I’ve learned.

## 🧠 What This Project Covers

- Loading and exploring the Titanic dataset
- Visualizing distributions by age, gender, and class
- Feature engineering with `StringLookup` and `Normalization` layers
- Building a simple neural network using the Keras Functional API
- Training and evaluating the model
- Plotting predictions and saving the trained model

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset is sourced from TensorFlow’s public Titanic dataset:
- [`train.csv`](https://storage.googleapis.com/tf-datasets/titanic/train.csv)
- [`eval.csv`](https://storage.googleapis.com/tf-datasets/titanic/eval.csv)
